For Project 2, you will build a physically interactive system of your choice. Please submit a proposal for your concept for this project, including a bill of materials and sketch of you the interaction and enclosure. 

Your [Project 2](/object-f17/project-2) proposal must include 3 things:

1. A ~200 word written proposal outlining your idea for Project 2. Focus on the ***WHY*** - why is this an interesting project? Why is it a valuable exploration for you in the context of this class. You should indicate both your concept as well as the technologies you intend to explore (what sensors, inputs/outputs, etc..).

2. A bill of materials. List everything you will need to make this project a reality. Include electronic components and materials for an enclosure.

3. A sketch or illustration of your intended design. This diagram should indicate the physical form of the project and also the interaction. Your sketch should demonstrate how someone will engage with the project. You may need more than one sketch to fully illustrate your idea.

Post your proposal to your blog. Project 2 Proposal is due before class on ***Thursday, November 2nd***.
