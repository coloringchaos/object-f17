In this lab, you will build the same circuit twice - once on paper using copper tape, and once on a breadboard. The goal of this lab is to become familiar with building simple circuits. You will practice calculating resistor values based on the power source and components you are using, and you will construct a creative enclosure for your hardware.

#### Tasks:

1. Set up your [Online Journal](/journal/) and submit the link [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdkvOkhTp1FimNm-o8jbxRfl2gip6AkCOmc4AGznV8-oRE06w/viewform?usp=sf_link)
2. Build the circuit (listed below) on paper using copper tape and a coin cell battery
3. Build the same circuit on a breadboard using a 9V battery or a power supply (between 5-12V)
4. Build a **creative enclosure** for one of your LED circuits (I highly suggest using cardboard, or extending your paper circuit)
5. Document what you made and post it to your blog *(see below)*

#### Lab 1 Resources:

+ Sparkfun's [how to use a breadboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard) and ITP's [setting up a breadboard](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/labs-electronics/breadboard/)
+ [ITP's Electronics Lab](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/labs-electronics/electronics/) - scroll down to the 'basic LED circuit' section
+ [LED Current](https://vimeo.com/album/2801639/video/78674965)
<!-- + [What is a Voltage Regulator](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/labs-electronics/components/) -->

#### For this lab you will need the following parts:

+ Copper Tape
+ Coin Cell Battery
+ A few LEDs
+ Solderless Breadboard and hookup wire
+ A switch
+ Resistor (you will need to calculate the value based on your power supply)
+ Barrel Jack to Breadboard connector
+ Battery or Power Supply (between 5-12V)

#### Copper Tape Circuit



#### Breadboarded Circuit

Use Ohm's law to calculate the resistor value based on the LED and power supply you are using.

#### Blog Response:

+ Post a short written description of what you created in this Lab and post *clear* photos of both the process and the final result
+ Briefly describe your goals for this class


#### Lab 1 is due before class on September 5th

Complete your blog post prior to class, and bring in what you made.
