In this lab, you will use serial communication to send data from P5 to Arduino. Use what you have learned in previous labs to build an interesting physical output (motors, lights, sound, etc..). Focus on coding an engaging visual interface in P5.

+ Explore serial communication between Arduino and P5
+ Send data from P5 to Arduino
+ Apply knowledge from previous labs to build a

+ [Github Repo with Serial to P5 Example Code](https://github.com/coloringchaos/Object_Examples/tree/master/Serial)
+ [P5 Reference and Examples](https://p5js.org/)
+ [The Coding Train](http://thecodingtrain.com/) - P5 examples
+ [Serial from P5 to Arduino](https://vimeo.com/239025173) (video)
+ [Full Serial Video List](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/videos/videos-serial-communication/)

Use the example code in the [Object Example Repo](https://github.com/coloringchaos/Object_Examples/tree/master/Serial) and your knowledge from previous labs to build something engaging.

Focus equally on the P5 coding and on the hardware, I want to see a cleaver and thoughtful interaction on the P5 side.

***Lab 7 is due before class on Tuesday November 7th***

Your blog response should include a *clear* video of what you made (show both the Arduino and P5 side), screenshots of your P5 design, a brief written description of what you made, and all of your code - either embed with GitHub Gist or shared via the P5 web editor. Submit a link to your blog post on D2L.
