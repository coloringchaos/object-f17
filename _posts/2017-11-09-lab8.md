The purpose of Lab 8 is to take the first step towards your final project. You will present your concept in class and receive feedback from the group. 

Craft a 5 minute presentation of your concept for project 2. Start your presentation stating what your project is and why. 

Your presentation must include visual assets - this could include interaction drawings, system diagrams, images of your initial tests, anything that explains and proves your concept.
